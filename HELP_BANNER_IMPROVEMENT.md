# Help Banner Improvement - Better UX

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The original "Edit Mode Active" banner had several UX issues:
- **Overlapped content** - Blocked the letter title and editor
- **Too large** - Took up significant screen space
- **Always visible** - No way to dismiss it
- **Poor positioning** - Fixed at top-right, blocking important UI elements

## ✨ Solution Implemented

#### 2. **Dismissible** ❌

- User has full control

#### 3. **Auto-Hide** ⏱️

## 🎨 Visual Design

### New Banner Style
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 💡 Quick Tip                    [X] │
│ Toolbar is at top-right! Select     │
│ text → Click Bold/Italic            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Styling

- **Text**: White with high contrast
- **Shadow**: Soft shadow for depth
- **Border Radius**: Rounded corners (xl)
- **Padding**: Compact (p-3)
- **Position**: Bottom-4 (safe from content)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [showHelpBanner, setShowHelpBanner] = useState(true);
```

### Auto-Hide Timer
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isEditing && showHelpBanner) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setShowHelpBanner(false);
    }, 5000); // 5 seconds
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [isEditing, showHelpBanner]);
```

### Reset on Edit Mode
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isEditing) {
    setShowHelpBanner(true); // Show again when entering edit mode
  }
}, [isEditing]);
```

### Animation with AnimatePresence
```typescript
<AnimatePresence>
  {isEditing && showHelpBanner && (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
    >
      {/* Banner content */}
    </motion.div>
  )}
</AnimatePresence>
```
