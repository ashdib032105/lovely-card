## 📁 What About quiz.ts?

The `src/config/quiz.ts` file still exists but is **not used** in the app flow. You can:
- **Ignore it** - It won't affect anything
- **Delete it** - If you want to clean up (optional)
- **Keep it** - In case you want to add quiz back later

---

## 🎯 Simplified Checklist

Now you only need to edit **3 config files**:

- [ ] `src/config/letter.ts` - Love letter
- [ ] `src/config/slides.ts` - Slide captions
- [ ] `src/config/gifts.ts` - Gift prizes

## ⏰ Time Saved

Without the quiz, you save approximately **5-10 minutes** of setup time!

**The app is now simpler and faster to set up! 🚀**
