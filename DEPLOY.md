## Troubleshooting

### Build fails?
```bash

rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

### Images not loading after deploy?
- Check that image paths start with `/` (e.g., `/slides/slide1.jpg`)
- Verify images are in the `public/` folder
- Check filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Music not playing?
- Verify file is named `background.mp3`
- Check file is in `public/audio/`
- Some browsers block autoplay - user needs to interact first
